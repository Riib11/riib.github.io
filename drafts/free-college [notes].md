# Notes

The goal of this short story is to demonstrate that free college will not solve all the problems that its advocates proclaim, in the ways they envision or at all.
However, this is not an explicit argument against it. In fact, the MC of the story will be hugely in favor and happy with the changes to "The New America". The dissonance will be seen when, even when the MC has the opportunities presented by free college + etc. they still dont really get much in the end because of higher standards and the loss of the _real_ advantages that used to come along with college. most of these scenarios will play off of postulating a continuing trend from where we are now, e.g. how so many jobs require a college degree now when most of them don't actually use anything you learned in school --- a college degree is just a good fitlering mechanism.

The MC will be a student of unspecified gender from a modest background, going to a pretty good college. Of course, there are many more college students in total now, since college is free. The MC goes through their classes with gratitude, recognizing that they are among the first in their family to go to college since before they couldn't afford it. The MC doesn't really like their classes, and its obvious that the classes are low on resources for individual students and that the professors don't really care that much --- they are hte worst of the worse professors because they have a much smaller budget to pay for free schools as opposed to paid ones. In fact, however, private schools are outlawed in the country. But there are plenty of schools over the borders that parents send their kids to instead --- say they go to mexico most of the time for this.

The MC is going through the motions of college and not really getting anything beneficial out of it and its painfully obvious. However, at every turn, the MC offers the usualy sorts of justifications for a liberal arts educations:
- [ ] well-rounded
- [ ] good citizen
- [ ] discipline for going into the job market
- [ ] other preparations for the job market
- [ ] helping disadvantaged students make connections
- [ ] equalizes playing field for disadvantaged students in all sorts of ways
- [ ] can learn what they are interested in pursuing

So the MC goes about their day feeling completely justified about their work, and they feel liek they are always making progress because there's always homework to do and all that. But many signs pop up throughout the story that point to the futility of the system:
- [ ] many students (including MC's friends) dont take class seriously, and only go to take exams because they only need to participate in order to get a "conditional pass"
- [ ] students only put on an act for show when they are at school in order to not get disciplined, but they aren't getting any interest in things that would contribute to well-roudedness
- [ ] there are many classes on supposedly useful skills, such as doing taxes, personal finances, job interviewing, etc. But they are really poorly run and since there is no interface with the real world it is accepted that the classes are mostly just to show the requirement of takign them i.e. in a job interview you would present that you took the "Job Interviews" class
- [ ] credentialism has just increased and increased. for many things, it isn't just required that you get a college degree, but that you complete many independent tests that you have to take outside of your college / after college / at graduate school
  - [ ] what we currently understand as college has been divided up into two levels: college and college II. This is because the standards at college are so low for many colleges that many jobs and most graduate schools require that you spend an extra 2-3 years at college II before you are actually qualified for what just normal college used to be adequate for. For example, right now a college degree is useful in the job market and will garuntee you a job at any Starbucks. But in the story the MC will find that many relatively low-level jobs require college 2 as well, to show that the applicant is persevering (but mostly to see that they are financially stable, after all the attrition of having to sacrifice so much time over the 6-7 years in school after high-school (junior college)).
