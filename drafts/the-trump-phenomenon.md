title: The "Trump" Phenomenon
author: Henry Blanchette
---

**Abstract:** Has Trump corrupted American politics and political news coverage? I think the affirmative answer is a popular opinion. More specifically, the claim I hear is that before Trump there was a certain standard for politicians and journalists, but now, because of Trump's rise, these standards have been significantly lowered by politicians, journalists, and common citizens alike. The key idea I identify in this claim is that Trump is _the cause_, or at least, _a significant cause_ of the craziness that is so obviously prevelant in modern American politics and political news coverage. I disagree. While I admit that Trump's rise has correlated with a rise and focus of craziness in politics and political news coverage, I reject that Trump is a significant cause of these phenomena. I call the rise of craziness and the focus of craziness about Trump in politics and political news coverage _The Trump Phenomenonâ„¢_. In this article essay, I argue that Trump is not a significant cause of The Trump Phenomenon.

**Idea:** The main idea I want to explore here is that I can maintain my thesis while still admitting that Trump has been involved in many specific instances of the craziness that I've been referring to. But what does it mean to say that Trump is _a significant cause_ of the craziness?
- One answer is to say "_A_ is a significant cause of _B_" iff "_A_ was significantly causally responsible for a significant number of the events that lead to _B_".
- A key word here is "significant," so I should be more specific about how I mean it
- So in this way, it is sufficient for me to show that there are enough sources significiantly causally responsible for The Trump Phenomenon other than Trump. What is the maximum amount of causally responsible attributable to Trump that still is consistent with my thesis? Well, it will be a spectrum, and I don't think I can make much of an accurate measurement, but I'd be satisfied with arguing for no more than 20%.

**Idea:** A good distinction to make is between _causal responsibility_ and _moral responsibility_. I do not mean to make a moral defense of Trump's actions. If I refer to some action being justified, I'll specify in what justification context.

**Idea:** Finally, the significance of my thesis. There are many problems in modern politics in political coverage, including but not limited to the following:
- corrupt politicians
- fearmongering politians
- fake news spread online
- clickbait-driven journalists
- loss of respect in poltical discourse among politicians, jounalists, and common citizens
- growing political polarity among citizens
- rise of enforcement of tribal, partisan politics
- demonization of your opposite political party
- filter bubbles of news
- outrage culture around political media
- domination of some major news outlets and social media sites by exclusive political idealogies
- loss of trust in political institutions
- fear for the survival of demoncracy
- trump derangement syndrom
- rise in popularity of political trolling taken seriously
- loss of faith in the feasibility of free speech, especially online
- loss of incentive for political comprimises
- widening cultural divisions among citizens
- tigher distribution of political views along demographic lines
- inability of members of a political party to accurately estimate the views in another political party

So the observation I really want to bring out is that while Trump is indeed the center focus point for so many instances of these problems, and he does more than his fair share (as an individual) of stoking the flames, these problems did not come into existence because of Trump and they will not be solved when Trump leaves office. Trump is just a convenient figure to point to as an example nexus where many of these problems are displayed, but thinking of the problems as coming from Trump and not the other way around is a distorted and distracted conception of how the state of politics in America is changing. Another way to say my conclusion is: if Trump was not elected, we would have all of the same problems in politics and political coverage, but it just wouldn't have a single additional factor, Trump, that is common to so many of them as we see now.

I interpret the purpose of the claim that Trump is the cause of so many of these problems (altogether, The Trump Phenomenon) is to explain why these problems exists and how they might be addressed. So my motivation in rebutting this claim is to point out that it is a bad explanation of the Trump Phenomenon and does little if anything to expose possible solutions to the problems associated. As has been propogated online in some cirlces, "Trump is the symptom, not the disease."

**Idea:** One last note actually, I think that one way of easing someone into accepting my argument is to point out that its kind of rediculous to think that someone as incompetent as Trump could singlehandedly demolish what's being held up as "the good old days" of politics and media. If it was really so easy for Trump to come in and smash everything, maybe it should be admitted that there was a little bit of pre-existing instability or potential that played a role in the result? There is only like one person in the entire world that thinks Trump is even successful by his own intentions (Scott Adams). For the record, this is not a complete argument, just an observation.

**Idea:** (The Hitler Objection)
If my thesis is accepted, couldn't it be applied equally well to Hitler in place of Trump, where fascist Germany was _The Hitler Phenomenon_? If so, then I'd be accpeting that, to some extent, Hitler wasn't a _significant cause_ of fascist Germany. And on the face of it, this is a rediculous claim.

Firstly, in order for my thesis to apply to Hitler, the premise that Hitler was not significantly causally responsible for a significant number of the events that lead to fascist Germany would have to be true. And here I maintain (although, in need of some conrete evidence but I think this is acceptable for now) that Hitler was in fact significantly causally responsible for a significant numnber of eents that lead to fascist Germany. In other words, it was not very accidental that Hitler rose to power, and there were a lot of events that Hitler was directly responsible for that did not rely on particular features of Hitler's environemnt.

Secondly, in evaluating the premise of my thesis as applied to Hitler, I think there is something valuable observed. Even in Hitler's case, there were many environmental factors difficult to causally attribute to Hitler that caused Hitler's rise, such as: Germany's financial situation after WWI, popular biases about Jews, hyper-nationalist sentiment, significant political instability of the Weimar republic, popular distrust of established politicians, popular hatred of the nations that defeated Germany in WWI and caused Germany's financial problems afterwards. So, in doing a causal analysis, these factors should also be heavily considered. And, like I said previously, I maintain that Hitler was still a significant cause alongside these external factors, so the difference in the application of my thesis to Trump is just at bottom a difference in measurement of proportional causal responsibility.
