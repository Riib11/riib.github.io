# Prompt

A person goes around their everyday life fairly normally in a realistic world. But they have this attachment they have to carry around with them all the time. Maybe it’s some weird thing attached to their body or something they feel compelled to hold all the time.

Whats eerie though is that it’s a very odd situation, but everyone treats it as normal, including the protagonist.

It’s curious what the attachment symbolizes, if it symbolizes anything. It would be interesting to try and come up with attributed to give the attachment, borrowing from some expectations about what it might symbolize, but not restricting to much to just one thing.

# Draft 1

I walked into the lunch room a few minutes early for the meeting.
Only half of everyone is here yet, but the room was too small its soon occupancy so it already felt full.
I made my way to my seat, and had to hold my thing above my head as I shimmied between some chairs and the wall.
Person1 and Person2 were sitting in the chairs, and my thing almost started dripping on them, but I caught the droplets with my head just in time.
I sat in the folding chair and stuffed my thing underneath.
Everyone else made their way into the room.

Eventally the boss appeared.
They greeted us enthusiastically.
Then the boss started extracting status reports from the drivers.
My thing pressed against my leg and felt very hot - my leg started to feel sweaty.
So I shifted over to my other leg to hold my thing in place under my seat.
I was up next.
I gave my report, which was very standard except for my mention of an issue with my GPS system.
Someone wrote the information down.
Then the boss transitioned onto the next order of business.
And then the next order.
And the next.

After the meeting, I helped put some of the folding chairs away since I couldn't get out of the room otherwise.
I held my thing under my arm as I carried the chairs, but my thing was slippery and oblong so I was very inefficient.
So I lopped my thing onto one of the tables.

"Sorry, could you please not put your thing there? Thank you."

I positioned my thing under my other arm and continued collecting chairs.
Next was my driving shift.
I poured myself some coffee and headed our to my waiting delivery truck.
I didn't think about the GPS issue, since I knew the routes well by memory anyway.
I put my thing in my pants pocket, then got into the driver's seat.
The windows were a little musty, so I wiped them off with a towel.
My thing started to expand out of my pocket and started rising into the air towards the open window.
I pulled it down and attempted to deflate it, then shoved it between my back and the seat's back.
Then I yelled out to the packers, asking if everything had been loaded.
They gave me the OK.

I drove to my first street then looked down my delivery list.
Then I drove up to the first house of the streel marked on my list and braked the truck.
I walked to the back of the truck and found the correct package.
Suddenly I heard the sound of glass breaking and looked to the front.
My thing had spilled all over the driver's seat and floor.
I put down the package and started scooping up my thing off all the surfaces, then pinched it into my pocket again.
Then I took the package to the front door of the house.
I layed down the package, pressed the door bell, and walked back to the truck.
I picked back up my list and marked off the first item.
Then I noted the next address, unbraked the truck, and continued my drive.
