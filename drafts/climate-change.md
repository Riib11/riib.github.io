So much of it is just fear mongering. And, as it turns out, there is good evidence to support very opposite actions to what many popular polititians forward. There is such a hugely disproportionate attack on "climate-change deniers" that doesn't allow for a popular critical perspective that can be addressed or sustained seriously. Additionally, "climate-change denial" has 'concept-creeped' into including also anyone that does not agree with the most progressive possible agendas relating to climate change (e.g. the Green New Deal).

A study I've found very enlightening is by Nordhause at the Copenhagen Instutite for Climate research (TODO: find links and evidence for this institute's reputation). Nordhause argues that supporting development rather than slowing it will have the most benefits on net, even though it allows for lots of short-term effects of climate change that many politicians taut as "the end of the world," such as sea levels rising. Nordhause's studies aknowledge that in order to fairly judge policies, the risk-adjusted damages of climate change need to be compared to the risk-adjusted damages of climate-change-countering policies (e.g. carbon taxes on developing countries such as India, China, etc.). 

Rather than cut efficiency and force the most vulnerable to pay more for fuel (e.g. developing countries that produce the majority of greenhouse gas emissions), it seems like a better path would be to focussing on raising as many people out of poverty as quickly as possible, since this leads to
- (a) more efficient use and production of energy (see all developed countries) and
- (b) the recently-developed countries' citizens starting to actually care about the environment when they don't have to worry daily about more pressing matters such as food and shelter.
