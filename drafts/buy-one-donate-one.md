# But One, Donate One

Can the donation of shoes to Africa be harmful?

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this article was the John Stossel video Lessons from Africa (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwIYgZZhehA), where Stossel considers "why " makes the following arguments:
1. African governments have too many and too complicated rules for a good business climate.
2. African taxes are too high for a good business climate.
3. African government have high corruption because of ineffective.
4. Foreign directives (e.g. via the UN) for helping African countries focus on relatively unimportant factors.
5. Foreign aid via governments and businesses, in the form of money and free products, are of negligable or perhaps even negative net benefit to African countries.

More specifically, the inspiration was argument 5. Stossel's prime example is Tom's shoes, a business that uses a "buy one, donate one" advertisement which promises that every purchase paid of shoes is matched by a donated pair of shoes to somewhere in Africa. Additionally, Stossel points out the the success of this "buy one, donate one" advertisement has prompted its expansion to many other companies, so there is a large variety of products that are donated to Africa in this way from companies, in addition to other aid.

So, the prompt for this article is the following:
> **Prompt.** Is the donation of products like shoes a net positive for their African recipients on the whole?

I will consider the case of donating shoes specifically, and consider the result general to other products like it.

My thesis is that these sorts of donations have a net positive effect only in the following conditions:
1. for humanitarian aid, such as natural disasters and war zones
2. for populations that both have a significant need for the donations and do not have a significant unemployment problem

In the second point, when I use "significant" I mean to qualify the formulation to mean "there is a net positive effect _to the degree_ that there is a need for the donations and _to the degree_ that there is not an unemployment problem."

<!-- ## Factors

In order to consider the effect of the shoe donations, break up the effect into two factors:
1. Effect on shoe-selling
2. Effect on shoe-buyers

Of course, this is not a partition of the  -->

## Factor 1: Affecting Business involved in Shoe-selling

The obvious negative effect of the shoe donations is on the local African shoe-selling business. Since shoe-sellers have to compete, to some extent, with free shoes they must lower their prices which decreases revenue. The suffering of the shoe-selling business will be distributed among all those involved in the business, which includes
- owners and employees of shoe-selling businesses, such as cobblers
- owners and employees of businesses that rely shoe-selling businesses, such as providers of the materials used in shoe-making, etc.

To some extent, business revenue will go down, businesses will close, and employees will be laid off or have their pay reduced. _Factor 1_ is the total of this effect.

Consider this study (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2008.02190.x), with the following abstract:
> This article examines the importance of one possible explanation for the failure of African countries to step onto the bottom rung of the manufacturing sophistication ladder, that is to produce apparel. Used‐clothing donations to thrift shops and other organisations in industrialised countries typically end up being sold to consumers in Africa. Since used clothing is initially provided as a donation, it shares characteristics with food aid, which always assists consumers, but at times harms African food producers. Used‐clothing imports are found to have a negative impact on apparel production in Africa, explaining roughly 40% of the decline in production and 50% of the decline in employment over the period 1981–2000.

Since such clothing donations are likely to have a similar impact of shoe donations, it supports the cliam that _Factor 1_ is negative.

## Factor 2: Affecting Consumers

The obvious positive effect of the shoe donations in on the African consumers who previously bought shoes or wanted shoes. To those that previously bought shoes, they now do not incur the cost of buying the shoes. Additionally, to those that previously wanted shoes (including those that also bought shoes), they now gain the benefit of having shoes. _Factor 2_ is the total of this effect.

Since both the removal of cost and the utility of having shoes are clearly positive effects, _Factor 2_ is positive in total.

## Factor 3: Affecting Labor

The third, final effect to account for is the change in labor that occurs due to the effects on business of the shoe donations. Before the donations, each employee and entrepenuer involved in shoe-selling (as specified for _Factor 1_), assuming they are rational on average, would only work in their current job if it yielded net positive returns them personally. Additionally, I assume that they did not have a clearly better option for work available, otherwise they would have taken it. So, when the returns on their work is impacted as considered by _Factor 1_, their work involving shoe-selling may no longer be the most rational choice of work, and for those which this is true they will change work to enter a more rational choice of work. _Factor 3_ is the total effect of this shifting of labor allocation.

There are two sub-populations for which _Factor 3_ is positive in different ways:
1. to those for which receiving shoes allows them take work with higher-returns, _Factor 3_ has a positive effect to the degree that this new work is better than their old work. otherwise, the effect of receiving shoes is negligable to _Factor 3_.
2. to those who change work due to the effects of the shoe donations on businesses involved in shoe-selling, _Factor 3_ has a positive effect to the degree that the new work is better than their previous donation-effected work

Since both of these sub-populations experience positive effects, _Factor 3_ is positive in total.

## Net Effect

The net effect is the sum of the three factors. In summary,
- the net effect is **positive** when the loss in returns to local businesses is outweighed by the utility gained by the people receiving shoes plus the mitigation of the loss in returns to local businesses by people reallocating their labor. I.e. `|Factor 1| < |Factor 2| + |Factor 2|`
- the net effect is **negative** when the loss in returns to local businesses outweighs the utility gained by the people receiving shoes and the labor negatively effected by the donations doesn't have more productive work to turn to. I.e. `|Factor 1| > |Factor 2| < |Factor 3|`

## Analysis

Shoes are a relatively low-cost item, so if _Factor 3_ is small compared to _Factor 1_, then it is unlikely that _Factor 2_ will be enough to outweigh _Factor 1_. _Factor 1_ can be so large because the positive the businesses and the entrepeneureal environment provides is not just the shoes they manufacture (which are replaced by the donations), but also the utility they produce through free trade and organization in the community.

In consideration of _Factor 3_ then, the key question is that of unemployement. Since there is high unemployment in many the places receiving these donations, I think that labor negatively effected by the losses in returns due to the donations is unlikely to have much better work to turn to. If there was so much better work to turn to, then there wouldn't be such unemployment. So, _Factor 3_ is relatively low. So, the effect is likely a net negative in such places.

## Conclusion

While there are probably some places in Africa where there is a high enough need and a low enough unemployment problem that these kinds of donations can be a net positive, I think that there are many more places for which the effect is a net negative, since the donations are being given without consideration for _all_ the factors that I outlined above. Of course there are going to be some people that benefit from the donations regardless of _Factor 2_, but the net effect can still be negative.

So there are roughly three circumstantes:
1. Donating shoes and other necessities to natural disaster victims and the like is still obviously a huge positive, but the reason is because its not hurting local businesses (there are likely none at the time) and the need is very high with no other way to satisfy it, and also the provisions are short-term. In other words, donate money necessities to disaster victims rather than Africa.
2. In a developing economy however, the circumstances are such that the benefits of having the businesses, and hence the jobs, available is more important on net than just the utility of the products they produce, since the reallocation of labor is not efficient (a claim supported by the existence of high unemployment rates in the areas donated to).
3. Finally, in a developed economy, a donations are small enough in volume not to hurt the shoe-selling business to a significant degree, and the donations will end up in the hands of only those who cannot afford shoes, since those who can already afford shoes would be unlikely get the donations, so _Factor 1_ and _Factor 3_ are negligable. Thus the benefits are almost entirely _Factor 2_, which is positive to some degree relative to the scale of the donations. In  other words, donate shoes to Canada rather than Africa (of course).
