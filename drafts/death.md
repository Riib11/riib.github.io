# Idea

When we say that something _killed_ a person, what exactly do we mean?

This in some ways boils down to the question of how to determine causal relationships, but I think that actually "kill" has much more contextual dependency.

Some examples that demonstrate the ambiguousness of this question:
- A government policy does a poor job delegating emergency resources, allowing more deaths than otherwise expected. Did the government _kill_ the people who would not have otherwise died?
- A government adopts bad economic policies, which lead to poorer standards of health, which leads to more deaths than otherwise expected. Did the government kill the people who would not have otherwise died?
- A person stabs another person. Did the knife _kill_ the victim? Did the wielder _kill_ the victim?
- A person develops cancer and then dies. Did the cancer cells _kill_ the victim? Did the victim's habits that lead to greater risks of cancer _kill_ the victim? Did the victim _kill_ themselves (cancer cells are part of your body)?

# Prompt

A society in which _killing_ is only attributed to the most directly detectable cause of death.

For example, if you stab someone, the wielder is not considered the killer, only the processes that occur in the victim's body that directly lead to their death are considered what killed the victim.
Of course, its not considered an accident that the knife caused the processes that caused the processes and so on that eventually caused the killing processes, but the causal chain is not considered transitive
My idea is that it's obviously true that causation is not transitive in general, but in cases like this people tend to have the intuition that causation is transitive. So, what if we didn't have that intuition? What would be different?

Some things I think would be different:
- In the knife example, the wielder (not considered the killer) would be assessed based on what was responsible for their actions, rather than stopping at some ultimate moralized subject as the object of responsibility. This follows from the lack of intuition about causal transitivity because in terms of causation and responsibility, the responsibility the the wielder had (in terms of willful action that we do hold them accountable for morally) was only for for their direct actions, not the further causal consequences of their actions. It would certainly be considered unwise that they did what they did, and an investigations into the causes of the causes of their actions would reflect something on their internal state given that they acted in such a way given the information they had. But it would not be considered so immediately immoral - rather just unwise, stupid, and incompetent.
- In the same way that people would not assume direct responsibility as a ultimate moral subject for bad results, they would also be unassuming about good results.
- Note that I'm not posing a futuristic world where we can read minds and predict people's actions perfectly. So its not the deterministic experiment. The world is exaclty like ours except that causation/responsibility is always considered non-transitive (definitionally? is it implausible that we wouldn't just come up with another word/concept for what we now lump in with causal intuition?)
