Growing up in suburban California, I recall the words "gender" and "sex" used almost interchangably. The only differences were that "gender" was used more often in social contexts and "sex" was used more often in biological contexts. But this distinction was not without many exceptions. I never thought about it very deeply. I did have a friend who adobted the label "genderfluid," and then later "transgender," but I knew them for a long time and they had many other issues, so they weren't very representative.

But once I began studying at Reed, I was quickly educated on a nomenclature distinguishing gender and sex. "Sex" made some reference to strictly biological characteristics, while "gender" referenced something less tangible. A couple other terms that came alongside this new conception of gender were "gender identity," "gender role," and a variety of nonbinary gender labels. As far as I've heard them used in conversation and writing, the definitions of these terms seem to along the following lines:
- _gender_ : the label of a group of people that are identified by certain social features, as socially constructed by one's society.
- _gender identity_ : the gender that an individual identifies as.
- _gender role_ : the stereotypical social behaviors associated with a gender.
- _nonbinary_ : the genders other than "man" and "woman".

Although this convention is seldom conventionally followed, I will adopt it for this article for the sake of clarity: the terms "male" and "female" will implicity assume a sex-oriented context, and the terms "man", "masculinity", "woman", "femininity", and "nonbinary" implicity assume a gender-oriented context.

The question that immediately arises to me, given the setup of gender as being unconnected to sex, is what exactly is the basis for the genders in the first place? Many Reedies would answer this question with an appeal to some of the following:
- social struggles allowed the powerful (esp. men) to maintain their power by keeping down others (esp. women and nonbinaries), promoting the construction of gender
- sex influences gender, yielding an appearance of their identification and bimodal distribution in society, but it is not a strict one-to-one correlation given their definitions as outlined earlier

The trick in these answers is to avoid admitting any of the following:
- the genders are defined by gender roles
- gender is only about the social manifestations biological features (esp. sex-related)

But this is where I start to lose my footing. Its a given that gender and sex correlate extremeley closely - that is, males and females are almost always men and women respectively, and there are relatively few gender-dysphoric cases. The exceptional case of inter-sex individuals is also extremely rare. So why is this the case? The explanation that gender was constructed as a way to maintain power seems to beg the question, how would the genders be defined in the first place to yield this? And shouldn't we see very different kinds of gender structures in other kinsd of societies? The evidence for this shows that the bimodal gender structure is as common among societies as its correlation with sex is common among individuals. So this path of reasoning suggests that gender is largely in human nature in some way, and even if it is socially constructed, it is hugely influenced by sex to the extent that the exceptions to the rule are better explained specifically that re-imagining the entire structure of gender and sex perhaps.

However, there are rare examples of societies that seem to have different gender structures, for example having 3 genders. But how can we tell that what they call gender is the same as what we call gender? Well, it seems that gender is recognized in these cases by the gender-roles, relating to reproduction, that are manifested. So what is the difference then between gender and gender-roles? If this path is taken to defend gender as an independent social construct from sex, its identification with gender-roles is hard to escape. The problem, of course, is that gender roles have changed over time whereas gender has not. Men are still men and women are still women even if they lived in different time periods and societies where the gender-roles were different. The only linking factor seems to have to refer to biology.

So the fork is to accept one and reject the other:
1. gender is gender-roles, a social construction
2. gender refers to sex, a biological feature

1 is problematic because gender-roles change but gender does not. 2 is problematic because it does not allow for genders that are unrelated to sex.

This is where I finally call back to "gender-identity." The way it has been presented to me is that to identify as a gender is a special motion that is hard to define. It at the very least makes the claim that one is in fact the gender which one identifies with, but also has emotional/spiritual connotations perhaps. And while it is silly to dispute whether or not an instance of such identification is genuine or not, it does become a hot topic to debate whether it is possible to incorrectly identify one's gender, and what evidence would be needed to settle such a dispute. Is it possible for a man to incorrectly identify as a woman?

Usually as I see conversations that regard this topic go, the presumption is that it is of no interest because why would you ever want to question someone's gender? If they are gender X, then treat them as gender X. Personally, this is pretty convincing. I don't have an special motivation or desire to question what a given person identifies their gender to be. But the question that is interesting to me is what exactly is one doing when one "identifies their gender?" Because in many cases, the act of identifying one's gender seems to be the act of identifying the gender-label that carries the stereotypes one most sees in themselves. Its a sort of self-labelling under the guise of escaping labels. There are two perspecives I see:
1. a gender label is important to one's identity, in that it describes something important about oneself in terms of the stereotypes associated with it
2. a gender label is unimportant, and one identifies as non-binary to escape any significance that a gender-label might be assumed to impart on them

The complication with 1 is that it presumes that genders have some sort of common definition that is significant to communicate to others. One identifies oneself as gender X, and does some things to get people to treat them in more stereotypical ways of gender X, as opposed to their previously identified gender. This seems to be against the progressive view that genders should not be treated stereotypically and that differences between genders in how people treat each other should be minimized.

The complication with 2 is that it presumes that genders are made up of stereotypes that are socially constructed (otherwise one could not so easily escape them) and reinforced be the desicion to identify oneself as not falling in line with those stereotypes, which members of the gender their were previousl recognized as should be. E.g. "I identify as non-binary because the stereotypes of gender X are correctly placed on that gender, and do not apply to me."
