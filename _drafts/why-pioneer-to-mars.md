title: Why Pioneer to Mars?
author: Henry Blanchette
---

When I say 'pioneer to Mars,' I don't mean pioneer just in general. I mean very much in particular the choice of an individual to become a pioneer. So the prompt of this article is, in other words, "what are the reasons for you to become a pioneer to Mars?"

To start off this discussion, I think a good analogy to consider is that between pioneers that settled the North American frontier and pioneers that would inhabit the first human Martian colonies (human as opposed to entirely autonomous).
- motivating power of this analogy, and what to derive from it
- explanatory power of this analogy, especially in considering the hazards of living in the first Martian colonies
  - mention a few of these questions, but will go into detain on them later:
    - what will the colonies be like?
    - what sort of skills will be needed?
    - are humans going to be needed at all in the early stages? or will we just wait until things are already super terraformed or something before actually sending humans?
- explanatory deficits of this analogy - what new problems Martian pioneers will face that American ones didn't, and the converse.
