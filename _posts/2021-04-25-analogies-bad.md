An _analogy_ is a claim that two things, \X and \Y are 'the same' with respect
to some aspect \P. As popularly deployed, analogies come in a variety of styles:

- _metaphor_ – "\X is \Y (_implicitly:_ with respect to \P)"; commonly idiomatic

  - e.g. "the news is music to my ears"
  - e.g. "time is money"
  - e.g. "my memory is foggy"
  - e.g. "the building is a maze"

- _simile_ – "\X is like \Y (_implicitly:_ with respect to \P)" or "\X is as \P
  as \Y"

  - e.g. "the desert was like an ocean of sand"
  - e.g. "the empty suitcase is as light as a feather"
  - e.g. "the paper is as white as snow"

- _allegory_ – a story about the \P of \X that parallels the \P of \Y

  - e.g. the story "Animal Farm" by George Orwell is about the corruption of a
    animal-managed farm that parallels the corruption of communism in the
    Russian Revolution of 1917
  - e.g. [Aesop's fables](https://aesopfables.com), such as the fable of "the
    fox and the grapes" which parallels the propensity to publically deride that
    which one is jealous of
  - e.g. the Star Trek episode "A Private Little War" which parallels the US
    involvement in the Vietnam War

- _anecdote_ – claim about the \P of \X as an example of the \P of \Y
  - "Here is an example of a young mother who is worrying about how to secure
    her children's next meal. Poor people in this neighborhood have it hard."
  - "Here is my experience in the field of data science. You can expect to have
    a similar experience as I did."

Analogy can be a useful way to communicate an intuition about the \P of \Y be
appealing to an intuition about the \P of \X. As an example of both analogy's
usefulness and of anecdote:

The analogy between electric circuits and water pipes is appealing, especially
before a detailed understanding of the underlying electrodynamics. But an
analogy can only go so far if the analogized things are not identical (in which
case we would have the identity analogy). Electric circuits are like water pipes
in a few high-level respects, but not in the vast majority of other respects.
Why doesn't electricity 'spill out' of a circuit with loose ends?

Overall, the water pipes analogy gives you an intuition about electric current,
but that intuition _didn't actually teach you anything about electric current_
(no matter how much it may _feel_ like you've learned something). Even the
analogical claim that electric circuits are like water pipes in a few particular
respects is not really something about electric circuits themselves, but
extrinsically about the relationship between water pipes and electric circuits.

I think that this observation is very often covertly sidestepped or just
ignored. Analogies so commonly are given as if they were arguments and even
explanations – all the time! Generally, there are two main tactics:

- "The \P of \X is that because \X is like \Y (_implicitly:_ with respect to \P)
  and the \P of \Y is that"
  - The analogy "\X is like \Y with respect to \P" is used as if it were an
    explanation, but it explains nothing about \X itself and relies purely on
    the extrinsic comparison between \X and \Y
  - e.g. "The Vietnam War is bad because the conflict in Star Trek's 'A Private
    Little War', which critiques the Vietnam War, is bad"
- "Here is an analogy that \X is like \Y (_implicitly:_ with respect to \P). So,
  \X is like \Y with respect to \Q!"
  - The conclusion sneaks in a new claim \Q that may look superficially similar
    or related to \P, but is not just \P.

TODO: more examples of bad analogical arguments

This 'misuse' of analogies is not really a misuse because I'm sure that
analogies have been used this way for as long as there have been people using
analogies. And generalizing understanding from a few examples to abstract traits
is an important part of how human learning and understanding works at all. The
main danger that I want to point out here, though, is that analogical arguments
are extremeley effective, satisfying, and intuitive. It's impossible not to make
them instinctually. But analogical generalizations are easily used to justify
the false, and often are even unintentionally.
