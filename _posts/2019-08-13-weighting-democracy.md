<!-- An article about the pros and cons of democracy in the view of its popular conception in the United States of America. -->

In the United States of America, Democracy is viewed as an integral to both the nation's identity and political system. However sympathies to alternatives have always been present in the popular discourse as well. Additionally, "Democracy" has gained so many political and moral connotations that the distinction between it and a more accurate description of our political process - as a democratic republic.

These observations inspire a few questions:
- Why is the concept of Democracy so important to the identity of the USA?
- What are the updsides and downsides to Democracy both in concept and in practice?
- How does Democracic practice in the USA compare to the ideal?

This article attempts to answer the second question, while touching contextually on the first and third. Additionally, this article is a prompt for a discussion on an episode of the Art of Thought podcast.

_Note_: I use "Democracy" capitalized not to refer to the Democratic political party in the USA, but to specifically refer to "democracy" as popularly conceived in the USA.

## What is Democract?

This section serves as an overview of what Democracy means in this article. There are many other resources that provide a more thorough foundation, but that isn't necessary here.

So, what is democracy (lower-case)? According to dictionary.com, democracy is

> government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system.

This definition serves as a landmark for considering Democracy, the flavor of democracy as concieved of in the USA. Importantly, the phrase "supreme power is vested in the people" regards every democratic government's loyalty to the popular desicions of citizens when they are submitted through the appropriate protocol.

Next, there are some important lines to draw between democracy and Democracy.

_Direct democracy_ is democracy where _all_ political desicions, legislative and executive, are made through some kind of popular vote among citizens. While this is commonly used in small groups, it is not how the American government operates or even pretends to operate at the national level.

_Absolute democracy_ is democracy where all democratic desicions are executed regardless of conflicts with the current law. The American national government contains a Supreme Court that is appointed and can, in some circumstances, rule against democractic desicions. The vast buerocracy that makes up the American national and state governments ensures that many democratic desicions are not faithfully executed as they are presented to the voting citizenry. And finally, new democratic desicions cannot override the American constitution unless the constitution is first ammeded to allow it. For example, American citizens cannot be declared guilty of serious crimes without the option for a preceeding trial by jury. So, the USA does not practice absolute democracy.

## The Upsides of Democracy

From a historical perspective,   Democracy seems to have coincided with the development of a hugely powerful and influencial country that is the USA. The USA is currently a global superpower unmatched in almost every aspect of international influence, and has been a top global superpower for at least a century.

As for domestic concerns, Americans enjoy some of the highest living standards ever experienced in any part of the world at any point in the past. Of course, the USA is not alone in this status --- these luxurious living standards are matched or surpassed in most of North America, most of Europe, and much in North-Eastern Asia.

Much of the USA's political success is popularly attributed to its faithful practice of Democracy. Some possible contributions of Democracy are:
- political stability
- political representation for citizens
- citizen participation in politics

Additionally, the USA does not practice absolute democracy.
