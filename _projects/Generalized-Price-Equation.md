In evolutionary theory, The [Price Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_equation) describes how a trait's frequency changes overtime throughout generations of a population, in terms of the covariance between trait frequency and fitness (in terms of number of children).
The [Generalized Price Equation (GPE)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.999052v1) generalizes the Price Equation to contexts outside of biological genealogies.
Novel phenomena become relevant, such as abstract genealogies where where members may have variable numbers of parents ([hyperparentality](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24006303_Generalization_of_the_Price_Equation_for_evolutionary_change)).

My work is on the application of and simulation of the GPE to "genealogies" of patents in the US patent record.
I am developing a web application for simulating and analyzing sample genealogies.
